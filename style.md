# Programming Style

Style is _very_ important.
The goals of a project's style typically revolve around making it simple, readable, and clean.
See [this post](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~gparmer/posts/2016-03-07-code-craftsmanship.html)
For some thoughts on how to make your code more readable, see the [Composite Style Guide](https://github.com/gparmer/composite/blob/ppos/doc/style_guide/composite_coding_style.pdf).

Please document in your repository (e.g. in the `README.md`) which coding style you're using.
If you'd like to understand the motivation behind a specific style, please see the [Composite Style Guide](https://github.com/gparmer/composite/blob/ppos/doc/style_guide/composite_coding_style.pdf).

It is important, when you're working on a team to use a consistent style.
It is more important to choose one and _stick with it_, than to choose the "perfect style".
You can find many different styles online, including

-   Google's C++ [style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), Java [style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), and Python [style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
-   Linux's C [style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)
-   GWU's OS research group's C [style](https://github.com/gparmer/composite/blob/ppos/doc/style_guide/composite_coding_style.pdf) along with justifications

Though not relevant for this class, many modern languages have prescribed styles such as [go](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/), and [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/rustfmt/).

_Style requirements for this class._
For the purposes of this class, _never_ bring code to the instructional staff or to peer review sessions that isn't properly indented.
That is the minimum bar that humans need to be able to understand code.
If you bring code that isn't indented, then we will think that you haven't put a sincere effort into understanding your code as you haven't invested care into making it understandable.
